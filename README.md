# kata_list_by_array

### Kata exercise – using just arrays, develop own list implementation (1 hour)

- Don't use interface which is defined in Java, but instead create own one with methods – void add(T item), T get(int index), T remove(int index), Boolean contains(T item)
- Don't google for anything more than Java API you want to use

- Please create a branch with your EPAM username and push to it.
- Please do not merge with master
