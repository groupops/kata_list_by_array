# kata_list_by_array

### Kata exercise – using just arrays
develop own list implementation (1 hour)

- Don't use interface which is defined in Java, but instead create own one with methods – void add(T item), T get(int index), T remove(int index), Boolean contains(T item)
- Don't google for anything more than Java API you want to use

- Please create a branch with your EPAM username and push to it.
- Please do not merge with master


### Kata exercise 2 – using ArrayList
implement the same interface making sure you encapsulate all other behaviors (30 minutes)
Review all solutions, think about good and bad things you can find together, discuss them (1 hour)

### Use only arrays implement Stack and Queue
if possible do it in pairs (pair programming) – switch every 10 minutes (2 hours)
